## What is L4T?

I'm going to assume you have a Jetson Nano and have completed
`vignette("aa-setting-up-the-jetson-nano")` and are at the Jetson desktop as
shown in "After Logging In" on the "Setup and First Boot" tab of
^[@NVIDIA2019b].

When you flashed the microSD card, the software you installed was a collection
of NVIDIA tools called
[`JetPack SDK`](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack)
[@NVIDIA2019c]. JetPack SDK is a mature collection of utilities for developing
edge computing applications on Jetson hardware. If you have time and are
interested in the state of the NVIDIA art, there are a wealth of tutorials and
examples, most of which will run on the Nano. See ^[@NVIDIA2019e] to get started.

The operating system component of JetPack SDK is called Linux for Tegra (L4T).
L4T is built on top of Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS "Bionic Beaver" running on the
64-bit ARM hardware (`arm64` or `aarch64` if you're into code names).

If you're familiar with Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS, most of this will be second
nature. Ubuntu is a very popular Linux distro, so if you're a Linux newcomer
you probably know someone who can show you around. But I'll show you what you
need to do to get the
[`edgyr-ml Docker image`](https://hub.docker.com/r/znmeb/edgyr-ml) up and
running.

## Updating the operating system

L4T is set up to periodically poll the internet for OS updates. If it finds
that updates are available it will open an app and ask you if you want to
install them. Unless you're an expert you should install the updates and
restart if required.

Here's what it looks like on a 7-inch 1024x600 screen:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./software-updater-app.jpg')
```

--------------------

Press the button (the circle with the "A" in it at the lower left) and the
Software Updater dialog will open:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./software-updater-dialog.png')
```

--------------------

Press the "Install Now" button. When it's finished, you'll see:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./restart-dialog.png')
```

--------------------

Press the "Restart Now" button. The system will restart and then you can log
back in.

## Remote access

At this point, you're all set up and can proceed to pulling the `edgyR` Docker
image and running it in a container. But you'll probably want to set up remote
access, so you can open a terminal from another machine with Secure Shell
(SSH) or share the Nano desktop via VNC.

If you have a typical home local area network (LAN), you have a router
somewhere connected to the internet and the router sets up a wireless LAN for
you. The router may have wired jacks in it that you can connect to directly as
well. In either case, the router assigned your Nano and every other device on
your home LAN an Internet Protocol (IP) address.

To find out what the IP address of the Nano is, open the dialog box in the
upper right. For a wireless connection it will be a wireless symbol and for a
wired connection like mine it will be two arrows. Then select the "Connection
Information" entry.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./ip-address.png')
```

--------------------

Towards the middle you'll see `IPv4` and then the IP address. So my Nano has
the IP address `192.168.254.23` on my wireless router's LAN.

Can I SSH to it from an RStudio terminal?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./ssh-to-nano.png')
```

--------------------

## `Unminimize`, `man`, `sudo` and all that
As the message states, the system has been minimized to save space. What's
missing is mostly documentation, and most of that is `man` pages.

`man` pages are one of the oldest parts of the Unix legacy; they were on the
earliest text-only Unix systems as a way of providing documentation at the
command line. This was before widespread internet usage, the World Wide Web,
personal computers, Google, and [Billie Eilish](https://www.billieeilish.com/).

You can still get `man` pages on Linux systems but there are both simpler and
richer forms of documentation available, so they aren't really necessary. If
you want them, type `sudo unminimize`. And wait. This will take a long time;
it is re-installing all the packages in L4T to get the bits that were not
shipped on the flash image!

And `sudo`? `sudo` stands for "superuser do", so it's pronounced "soo-doo".
But don't be surprised if you hear it pronounced "pseudo". `sudo` lets you run
commands that normally require superuser privileges, like installing L4T
packages and starting Docker containers. So we'll be using `sudo`. When `sudo`
asks for a password, it's *your* password -- the one you specified when you
set up the system.

## Remote desktop

As noted above it is also possible to share the desktop. This is a bit tricky
to set up, so I'll simply show you where the instructions are and let you do
it if you wish.

On the dash at the lower left, there's a button labeled `L4T-README`:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./l4t-readme.jpg')
```

--------------------

Click once on it to open it up:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./README-vnc.png')
```

--------------------

Double-click on `README-vnc.txt`:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./configuring-vnc.png')
```

--------------------

## Booting to a Linux console

If you're planning to access the Nano mostly via remote SSH sessions and
RStudio Server or JupyterLab web services inside an `edgyR` container, you
won't be using the full L4T desktop.

The full L4T desktop takes up more RAM than a Linux console, and the Nano has
only 4 GB of RAM. To set the Nano to boot to a Linux console, enter

```
sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
sudo systemctl reboot
```

To set it back to a full desktop, enter

```
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
sudo systemctl reboot
```
